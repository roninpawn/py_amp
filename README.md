# Py_Amp - A WinAmp Clone made in Python

## Status
Just getting started. At time of writing I've got less than a full week's spare-time efforts into this. And it goes to show how quickly guiABLE gets you from a blank page to a polished UI, that I've got a fully functioning audio player (sans any playlist capabilities) in just a few days effort.

## Intended Features
- Playback of most audio formats. ✅
- Livestream convenience buttons.
- EQ visualization like the original WinAmp had.
- Multiple, tabbed playlists with various sorting methods, including 'randomize.'
- A soundboard? ...that provides an expandable, populatable, resizable grid of buttons to which audio can be attached?

## Why?
Py_Amp exists foremost as a showcase and testbed for the capaabilities of my [guiABLE](https://github.com/roninpawn/guiABLE/tree/guiABLE2) library... A GUI library that makes custom, gorgeous windowed applications possible atop Python's native Tkinter -- and with zero dependencies. Just pure Python code. But it also exists to fill a gap in my own software collection. I've wanted for a simple, clean audio player that isn't bloated with album-management fooey, circa the original WinAmp. The closest thing I've found to what I'm looking for is AIMP. And it gets my recommendation, in case you're also in the market.

But as a livestreamer, I want some truly custom features. Buttons to do slow fade outs, or quick fade-drops into the background. And, hey! What if a soundboard for fake applause and fart noises!? _(what more do you need outta life?)_

That's what has brought me to making Py_Amp. I needed a test/example project for guiABLE. And I wanted my own custom audio player. Simple as that.
