# Py_Amp - A WinAmp Clone made in Python

## Why?
Py_Amp exists foremost as a showcase and testbed for the capaabilities of my [guiABLE](https://github.com/roninpawn/guiABLE/tree/guiABLE2) library... A GUI library that makes custom, gorgeous windowed applications possible atop Python's native Tkinter -- and with zero dependencies. Just pure Python code. But it also exists to fill a gap in my own software collection. I've wanted for a simple, clean audio player that isn't bloated with album-management fooey, circa the original WinAmp. The closest thing I've found to what I'm looking for is AIMP. And it gets my recommendation, in case you're also in the market.

But as a livestreamer, I want some truly custom features. Buttons to do slow fade outs, or quick fade-drops into the background. And, hey! What if a soundboard for fake applause and fart noises!? _(what more do you need outta life?)_

That's what has brought me to making Py_Amp. I needed a test/example project for guiABLE. And I wanted my own custom audio player. Simple as that.
